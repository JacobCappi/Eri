const always refers to left, unless nothing left, then right

``` foo(const int *bar) ``` // Pointer to Const
Points to a const int, aka, can't modify the int
Pointer is not const, so can change what it points to

``` foo(int *const bar) ``` // Const pointer
const pointers, aka can't modify the pointer
whatever is inside can change

``` const foo bar(void) ```
done somewhere, but probably is more harm than good

``` foo bar(void) const ```
guarentees the internals of the class are not changed
