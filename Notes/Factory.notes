Should also be a subsystem:
    I think the interface is just nice, but I probably won't call it by one
    'not for abstraction, just for predictability?

Startup:
    should instance all subsystems

Shutdown:
    Not sure how to keep track of them, but these should kill all pointers here

get() for every subsystem
    -> How does that work in terms of thread safety?
    -> can two use the same logger simultaneously?
