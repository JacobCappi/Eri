Start 05 August 2021:
  Lightweight 3D engine using Vulkan
  Planning on Windows and Linux platform layer to develop on both OS.
  Using clang for both OS's, and plan on using a lightweight Build System.
  
08 August Finishing up the logging and assertions with the help of Kohi Engine

Goal: Windows Application layor by next week ( 15 August )
  -> Side note: most of the complicated setup seems complete, so no need to rely on KOHI engine anymore
  -> Windows application layor will be built myself using win32 api
